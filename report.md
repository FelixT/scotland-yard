Scotland Yard Project Report
====

## Details

- strictly 3 pages
- at least 1 page summary on what has been done
- at most 2 pages reflecting on achievements
- brief critical reflection
- "The report does not have to cover all things implemented in detail, but should be seen as an overview of the work judged in conjunction with code and presentation - teams can use it during the presentation as an aid. The report should be concise, clear and to the point"

## Summary on what has been done

- implemented the spec? lol
- ai

## Achievemens

- OO concepts?
- polymorphism used by moves: allows us to return e.g. a set containing 'Moves' while each of these might be PassMove, TicketMove or DoubleMove. Each of these inherits the Move class
- 'consumer' used for accept (callbacks)
- visitor model
- dynamic dispach (but i don't think we used this?)
- DRY principle
- abstraction
- model view controller?

## (brief) reflection

- instanceof = bad
- ai sucks
- should split the model into different files ideally
